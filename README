Pong Game 2021 Spring
Ege DoÄŸukan Seven 76215

Basically I seperated the project into three parts as recommended in instructions. TopPanel, MiddlePanel and BottomPanel. 

Rungame:
There, I create a new GameWindow object which starts the game. 

GameWindow:
This is the main JFrame of the game. Where everything is joined together. 

TopPanel:
As is in the instructions I placed level, score, lives, timer here. I used labels for all of them. And then I placed TopPanel, which extends JPanel, to the Gamewindow using borderlayout.

MiddlePanel:
This is where the game is. I created an abstract class "sprite" for objects like paddle, ball etc. and then created their own classes inheriting the sprite class. Then I combined those classes to make the game in MiddlePanel. As well as implementing the game mechanics such as lives and collisions etc. So this is where the game progreses/ ends. And then implemented it to GameWindow with borderlayout. 

BottomPanel:
There we have the play/pause button as JButton. 

Sprite:
It is the parent abstract class for Ball and Paddle. I contains location info, setters getters, and abstract move method. 

Ball:
Inherits sprite. It has its own special move method. As well as reset and draw methods. 

Paddle:
Inherits sprite. IT has its own special move method. I implemented keyPressed and keyReleased methods and then combined them in MiddlePanel to move the paddle.

**I could not fully finish the powerups part and the play/pause button. So their functions are limited/ not working.
